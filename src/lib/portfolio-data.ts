  aboutMe: [
    "My professional path combines several areas that may look separate at first: AI evaluation, content systems, web-focused digital thinking, technical documentation, and security research. In practice, these areas share the same foundation. They all require careful reading, structured thinking, evidence checking, and the ability to explain complex issues in a way that helps people make better decisions.",

    "From there, I break the work into manageable parts. I identify the criteria, collect or review the relevant evidence, compare alternatives, and produce an output that is not only complete but explainable. This approach helps me stay consistent in tasks that require judgment, especially where a fast answer can easily become a wrong answer.",

My approach is structured, evidence-based, and designed to support reliable human judgment.",

    "Good AI evaluation improves model reliability. It helps teams identify where outputs fail, why they fail, and what needs to improve. My value is in bringing careful judgment to that process: not just marking an output as good or bad, but explaining the practical reason behind the judgment.",
  relatedExperience:
    "My AI evaluation experience includes work with Remotasks and TELUS Digital, where I contributed to data annotation, AI response evaluation, quality review, and guideline-based task execution. I also apply evaluation thinking in my generative AI content workflows, where outputs must be reviewed for coherence, realism, factual alignment, narrative quality, and audience suitability.",

  whyItMatters:
    "Data annotation is often invisible to end users, but it has a direct effect on how AI systems learn. If labels are inconsistent, unclear, rushed, or misapplied, the model can absorb weak patterns. If annotation is careful and consistent, it supports better model behavior, stronger evaluation, and more reliable outputs. Human-in-the-loop review remains important because AI systems still need people to interpret ambiguous cases, recognize nuance, identify edge cases, and apply judgment where automated systems may miss context.",

  headline: "Security Research Guided by Evidence, Responsible Testing & Clear Risk Communication",
  intro:
    "My security research approach is careful, authorized, and documentation-focused. I work to understand how systems behave, identify weaknesses, validate impact safely, and communicate findings in a way that helps teams fix issues without exposing unnecessary risk.",
  philosophy:
    "Security testing is not only about finding a technical flaw. It is about understanding the system, validating the behavior responsibly, explaining the real-world impact, and recommending a practical remediation path. My security research is shaped by responsible disclosure principles — testing within authorized scope, avoiding unnecessary disruption, protecting user data, and communicating findings through proper channels.",
  methodology: [
    { step: "Scope understanding", body: "Review the authorized asset scope, rules of engagement, permitted testing methods, and disclosure expectations." },
    { step: "Reconnaissance", body: "Identify visible assets, technologies, entry points, authentication flows, API behavior, headers, redirects, upload paths, and trust boundaries." },
    { step: "Hypothesis building", body: "Identify where security controls may be weak, inconsistent, missing, or misconfigured." },
    { step: "Safe validation", body: "Confirm the behavior using controlled testing, researcher-owned accounts, benign payloads, and minimal-impact requests." },
    { step: "Evidence collection", body: "Capture only what is necessary to prove the issue without exposing customer data or causing harm." },
    { step: "Impact analysis", body: "Explain the realistic business, user, regulatory, operational, or security consequence of the weakness." },
    { step: "Remediation writing", body: "Provide practical, technically relevant recommendations that help the team address the root cause." },
    { step: "Responsible reporting", body: "Submit findings through approved channels with clear reproduction steps, evidence references, severity reasoning, and disclosure notes." },
  ],
  interestAreas: [
    "Authentication and authorization weaknesses.",
    "Rate limiting and brute-force resistance.",
    "File upload validation and content handling controls.",
    "Cross-origin and browser trust boundary issues.",
    "Redirect validation and phishing-resistant flow design.",
    "API security misconfiguration and exposure analysis.",
    "Business impact analysis and remediation planning.",
    "Responsible disclosure reporting and evidence handling.",
  ],
  reportingStyle:
    "My reporting style focuses on clarity and usefulness: what the vulnerability is, who can trigger it, what access or impact it could create, why the organization should care, how to reproduce the issue safely, what evidence supports the finding, how severity was assessed, and what remediation steps are recommended.",
  publicNote:
    "I can discuss my general methodology, security principles, categories of testing, responsible disclosure approach, and reporting process. I do not publicly disclose confidential engagement details, affected organizations, exact assets, endpoints, screenshots, payloads, staff information, customer data, or private report content unless disclosure is explicitly authorized.",
